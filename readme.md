This is my main repository containing all open code I've written intended to to be used on the Raspberry Pi® series of single-board computers and micro-controllers.

Whilst some code may have some level of universatility to them, they are not tested for other/third-party devices and no liability or responsibility for any damaged caused through the usage of code from this repository is accepted.
